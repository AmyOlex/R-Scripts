#Overview
This report presents the `r SURVIVAL` KM plots for the `r CANCER` TCGA data that have both clinical and RNASeq data available. In this analysis I chose pairs of our genes of interest using expression thresholds based on the previous `r SURVIVAL` report using single genes.  The goal is to determine if there is a difference in disease recurrence or survival if multiple genes in the pathway are regulated in a specific way.  Thus, in this report I'm comparing patients where both genes in a pair are expressed with the pattern `r PATTERN` with respect to their inidividual cutoffs to all other patients.   

##Patient Overview

There are `r dim(cropped_gene_exp)[1]` `r CANCER` patients with tumor RNASeq data, and `r dim(tcga)[1]` patients with usable `r SURVIVAL` time points. Intersecting these data leaves `r length(intersect(row.names(cropped_gene_exp), row.names(tcga)))` patients to generate the survival curves.

#Methods

##Obtaining `r SURVIVAL` Data

Leo provided the `r SURVIVAL` data for this analysis.  He went through all the clinical data by hand.  

##Censoring

If `CENSOR` is greater than 0 then this report contains artificially censored survivial data at `r CENSOR` days.  Any value greater than `r CENSOR` days is changed to "`r names(CODE[1])`" and with an event time of `r CENSOR` days.  

The following are the number of patients that were censored at `r CENSOR` days:
```{r}
if(CENSOR>0) print(length(censor))else print(0)
```


##Discretizing Expression of Gene Pairs

Cutoffs for high or low expression were chosen based on the most significant `r SURVIVAL` division from the initial single gene report, and are printed out in the table below along with the associated survival analysis p-value for using that gene individually. If both genes in a pair are greater than the gene-specific thresholds below the pair is considered as both high.  Otherwise the pair is not both high. This method holds for any pattern.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8}
grid.table(cutoff_tbl, gpar.coretext=gpar(cex=.8), gpar.coltext=gpar(cex=.8, fontface="bold"))
```

#Results

Below are the KM-plots for this analysis.  I only printed out the plots tht met the following criteria:

 - There were at least `r GROUP_MIN` patients in the `r PATTERN` and Not `r PATTERN` categories.
 - The survival analysis is significant at the p=`r PVAL` level.
 - The survival analysis p-value is less than BOTH of the p-values obtained via using either gene individually.

The last criteria was implemented because some of these genes are able to divide the patients for `r SURVIVAL` with highly significant p-values.  Thus, I wanted to make sure using the pair of genes was more informative than using either individually.
